<h2>Comprehensive In-Patient and Out-Patient Treatment</h2>
Welcome to the home of the XYZ clinic. At the XYZ clinic we are equipped to tackle a broad range of diseases and ailments. 
Our modern facilities comfortable and affordable. Should your condition necessitate it, we have a range of wards available varying by your individual desires and needs. Our specialties include:
<ul>
<li>General Practice</li>
<li>Preventitive Health</li>
<li>Pathology</li>
<li>Radiology</li>
<li>Immunology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Admission</h2>
We provide both in-patient and out-patient care. If it has been determined that your condition is serious enough to warrant it - you will be admitted under the care of one of our capable doctors. A doctor is only permitted to care for 3 in-patients at a time, so you know you will be receiving close attention and the very best of care.

<h3>Belongings</h3>
Your belongings will be inspected at the time of admission in order to ensure no unsafe items are admitted. Bring only necessary items and eschew valuables, as we cannot provide dedicated secure space.

<h3>Nurses</h3>
Nursing staff will always be available to you and you can summon assistance at any time by clicking a button conveniently located by your bed. Further details of staffing and shift arrangements can be found on the duty board or by inquiring at reception.

<h2>Treatment Program</h2>
We have a motto at XYZ - "Resistance is futile". Of course, we refer to the disease. We begin with a full diagnostic work-up followed by a detailed history and consultation.
