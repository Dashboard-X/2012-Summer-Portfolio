    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    This policy covers how we use your personal information. The security of your private
    information is very important to us, and will take all measures to protect your personal information.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong><br />
    <br />
    When processing payment, we only collect information that we need that is related to your order. This includes
    your:<br />
    Billing Address<br />
    Credit Card Information<br />
    <br />
    For general site access, we also collect information on your IP address, browser type, and Refer
    URL data. We use this data to prevent hacking attempts, help us know what web browsers
    people are using, and find out where our visitors are coming from.
    <br />
    Finally, medical information collected by you physician will likely be stored in our database. It is our
    policy to always record in-patient information, and in the majority of cases out-patient information is
    recorded to. At the conclusion of your visit you may request to have any such records transferred to your
    possession.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>How Is My Information Used?</strong><br />
    <br />
    Your information is only used to assist your doctors in treatment and in accepting payments. We do not sell or redistribute
    your information to ANYONE.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Security and Storage</strong><br />
    <br />
    Only your order medical information is stored on our
    server. Your credit card data will likely be sent over the internet in plain-text, thus rendering us unable to deal with any credit card processors. 
    However, you can take comfort in the knowledge that we do not store your Credit Card data.
    The reasoning behind this is simply because HTTPS is not a requirement of the assignment.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Cookies and Browser Information </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Cookies are small files that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you
    on your next visit or store your shopping cart contents. We use them only to track
    this information.
